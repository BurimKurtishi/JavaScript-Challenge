# JavaScript-Challenge

In this challenge employee payroll tracker I was asked when you click on the add button to present a promp button.

I crated a javascript a code to add a promp and to collect the infromation about the employees with an option to cancel the promp when the all informations was gatherd.

I used a employeesarray.reduce to calculate a average salary for the employees.

Also I used math.floor and math.random to select and display a random employee.
